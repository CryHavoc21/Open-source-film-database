# Open Source Film Database

This deposit comes from the site The Big Film Database (http://industrieplus.net/dxdatabase/).

I created this tool in February 2018, but for the past two years, it has hardly been updated. My free hosting on the server will likely expire in 2024.

Therefore, I have decided to make the database available to the community under the Creative Commons CC BY-SA 4.0 license.

I hope that a new project will emerge to continue enriching this knowledge base, which is useful to all photographers and image history enthusiasts. Please respect the license when reusing the work so that it benefits everyone.
